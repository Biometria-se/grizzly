"""@anchor pydoc:grizzly.auth.aad Azure Active Directory
Grizzly provides a way to get tokens via Azure Active Directory (AAD), in the framework this is implemented by {@pylink grizzly.users.restapi}
load user and {@pylink grizzly.tasks.clients.http} client task, via the `@refresh_token` decorator.

It is possible to use it in custom code as well, by implementing a custom class that inherits `grizzly.auth.GrizzlyHttpAuthClient`.

For information about how to set context variables:

* {@pylink grizzly.steps.background.setup.step_setup_set_global_context_variable}

* {@pylink grizzly.steps.scenario.setup.step_setup_set_context_variable}

Context variable values supports {@link framework.usage.variables.templating}.

There are two ways to get an token, see below.

## Client secret

Using client secret for an app registration.

```gherkin
Given a user of type "RestApi" load testing "https://api.example.com"
And set context variable "auth.tenant" to "<provider>"
And set context variable "auth.client.id" to "<client id>"
And set context variable "auth.client.secret" to "<client secret>"
And set context variable "auth.client.resource" to "<resource url/guid>"
```

## Username and password

Using a username and password, with optional MFA authentication.

`auth.user.redirect_uri` needs to correspond to the endpoint that the client secret is registrered for.

```gherkin
Given a user of type "RestApi" load testing "https://api.example.com"
And set context variable "auth.provider" to "<provider>"
And set context variable "auth.client.id" to "<client id>"
And set context variable "auth.user.username" to "alice@example.onmicrosoft.com"
And set context variable "auth.user.password" to "HemL1gaArn3!"
And set context variable "auth.user.redirect_uri" to "/app-registrered-redirect-uri"
```

### MFA / TOTP

If the user is required to have a MFA method, support for software based TOTP tokens are supported. The user **must** first have this method configured.

#### Configure TOTP

1. Login to the accounts [My signins](https://mysignins.microsoft.com/security-info)

2. Click on `Security info`

3. Click on `Add sign-in method`

4. Choose `Authenticator app`

5. Click on `I want to use another authenticator app`

6. Click on `Next`

7. Click on `Can't scan image?`

8. Copy `Secret key` and save it some where safe

9. Click on `Next`

10. Open a terminal and run the following command:

    === "Bash"

        ```bash
        OTP_SECRET="<secret key from step 8>" grizzly-cli auth
        ```
    === "PowerShell"

        ```powershell
        $Env:OTP_SECRET = "<secret key from step 8>"
        grizzly-cli auth
        ```

11. Copy the code generate from above command, go back to the browser and paste it into the text field and click `Next`

12. Finish the wizard

The user now have software based TOTP tokens as MFA method, where `grizzly` will act as the authenticator app.

#### Example

In addition to the "Username and password" example, the context variable `auth.user.otp_secret` must also be set.

```gherkin
Given a user of type "RestApi" load testing "https://api.example.com"
And set context variable "auth.tenant" to "<provider>"
And set context variable "auth.client.id" to "<client id>"
And set context variable "auth.user.username" to "alice@example.onmicrosoft.com"
And set context variable "auth.user.password" to "HemL1gaArn3!"
And set context variable "auth.user.redirect_uri" to "/app-registrered-redirect-uri"
And set context variable "auth.user.otp_secret" to "asdfasdf"  # <-- `Secret key` from Step 8 in "Configure TOTP"
```
