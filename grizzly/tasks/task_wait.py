'''
@anchor pydoc:grizzly.tasks.task_wait Task Wait
This task sets the wait time between tasks in a scenario.

The default is to wait `0` seconds between each task.

This is useful in a scenario with many tasks that should have some wait time between them, but there are a group
of tasks (e.g. Transform, Date or Log Messages) that should execute as fast as possible.

If `max_time` is not provided, the wait between tasks is constant `min_time`. If both are provided there will be a
random wait between (and including) `min_time` and `max_time` between tasks.

## Step implementations

* {@pylink grizzly.steps.scenario.tasks.step_task_wait_constant}

* {@pylink grizzly.steps.scenario.tasks.step_task_wait_between}

## Statistics

This task does not have any request statistics entries.

## Arguments

* `min_time` _float_ - minimum time to wait

* `max_time` _float_ (optional) - maximum time to wait
