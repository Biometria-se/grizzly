    __vector__: Optional[Tuple[bool, bool]]

    This class variable represents `(x, y)` dimensions on how the values can expand in a step expression.

    Consider the following `Enum`, being mapped to a custom `parse` type named `FruitType`:

    ``` python
    from behave import register_type


    class Fruit(PermutationEnum):
        __vector__ = None  # see examples below

        BANANA = 0
        APPLE = 1
        ORANGE = 2

        def from_string(cls, value: str) -> Fruit:
            return cls[value.upper()]

    register_type(
        FruitType=Fruit.from_string,
    )
    ```

    ##### `None`

    Variable occurs `1..N` times in the expression

    When permutated, it will only produce one step expression and all instances of the variable in the expression will have been replaced with nothing.

    ``` gherkin
    Then I want to eat a "{fruit:FruitType}"  # -->

    Then I want to eat a ""

    Then I want to eat a "{fruit1:FruitType}" and a "{fruit2:FruitType}"  # -->

    Then I want to eat a "" and a ""
    ```

    ##### `(False, True,)`

    Variable occurs `1` time in the expression.

    When permutated, it will produce the number of step expressions as values in the enum.

    ``` gherkin
    Then I want to eat a {fruit:FruitType}  # -->

    Then I want to eat a banana
    Then I want to eat a apple
    Then I want to eat a orange
    ```

    ##### `(True, False,)`

    Variable occurs `2..N` times in the expression.

    When permutated, combination of all enum values will be produced, if the variable type occurs the same number of times as values in the enum.

    ``` gherkin
    Then I want to eat a {fruit1:FruitType}, a {fruit2:FruitType} and a {fruit3:FruitType}  # -->

    Then I want to eat a banana, a apple and a orange
    ```

    ##### `(True, True,)`

    Variable occurs `2..N` times in the expression, and should produce more than one combination of the step expression.

    ``` gherkin
    Then I want to eat a {fruit1:FruitType}, a {fruit2:FruitType} and a {fruit3:FruitType}  # -->

    Then I want to eat a banana, a apple and a orange
    Then I want to eat a apple, a banana and a orange
